	"Love Story" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. She produced the song with Nathan Chapman. It was released on September 12, 2008 by Big Machine Records, as the lead single from Swift's second studio album Fearless (2008). It was written about a love interest of Swift's who was not popular among Swift's family and friends. Because of the scenario, Swift related to the plot of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (1597) and used it as a source of inspiration to compose the song. However, she replaced Romeo and Juliet's original tragic conclusion with a happy ending. It is a midtempo song with a dreamy soprano voice, while the melody continually builds. The lyrics are from the perspective of Juliet.
